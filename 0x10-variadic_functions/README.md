# variadic function

is a function that takes a variable number of arguments. In other words, the number of arguments passed to the function can vary at runtime.

In most programming languages, including C, C++, Java, and Python, variadic functions are implemented using an ellipsis (...) in the function signature. For example, in C and C++, a variadic function is declared as follows:

```

int my_function(int arg1, ...);

```

In this example, **`arg1`** is a required argument, and the ellipsis indicates that there can be an arbitrary number of additional arguments.

To access the additional arguments within the function, you typically use a va_list object and a set of macros to retrieve each argument. For example, in C and C++, you might use the following code to retrieve the additional arguments:

```
#include <stdarg.h>int my_function(int arg1, ...)
{
    va_list args;
    va_start(args, arg1);
    int arg2 = va_arg(args, int);
    float arg3 = va_arg(args, double);
    // ...
    va_end(args);
    // ...
}

```

Here, **`va_start`** initializes the **`args`** object, and **`va_arg`** retrieves each additional argument. The type of each argument must be specified explicitly in the **`va_arg`** call.

Variadic functions are commonly used in situations where the number of arguments is not known at compile time, such as when writing a printf-like function that can take an arbitrary number of arguments of different types.
