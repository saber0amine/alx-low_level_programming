# function pointers

Function pointers are variables that hold the memory address of a function. They are used in C and C++ to allow functions to be passed as arguments to other functions, or to be assigned to variables and called later.

To declare a function pointer, you use the following syntax:

```
return_type (*ptr_name)(arguments);

```

where **`return_type`** is the return type of the function, **`ptr_name`** is the name of the function pointer variable, and **`arguments`** are the arguments that the function takes.

For example, the following code declares a function pointer named **`pfunc`** that takes an integer argument and returns an integer:

```
int (*pfunc)(int);

```

You can assign a function to a function pointer variable like this:

```
int add(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}

int (*pfunc)(int, int) = &add;

```

In this example, **`pfunc`** is assigned the address of the **`add`** function.

You can call a function through a function pointer by using the dereference operator **`*`**:

```
int result = (*pfunc)(3, 4);

```

In this example, the **`add`** function is called through the **`pfunc`** function pointer with arguments **`3`** and **`4`**, and the result is stored in the **`result`** variable.

Function pointers are particularly useful when you want to pass a function as an argument to another function, such as in a sorting algorithm where you want to be able to sort an array using different comparison functions.
